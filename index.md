Check out some of my projects above.

The RS Timer is a simple timer program with general-length timers and daily, weekly, and monthly timers based on the 0:00 GMT daily reset times used by RuneScape.

The Logger Factory is a simple Java logger factory that returns java.util.logging.Logger objects preconfigured to output to System.out and System.err. Output verbosity is based on the global logging level. The factory provides a preconstructed, customizable formatter automatically applied to all loggers it returns which prints more or less information in output based on logging level.
