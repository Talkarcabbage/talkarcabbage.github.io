Check out some of my projects above.

The RS Timer is a simple timer program with general-length timers and daily, weekly, and monthly timers based on the 0:00 GMT daily reset times used by RuneScape.

The Logger Factory is a simple Java logger factory that returns `java.util.logging.Logger` objects preconfigured to output to `System.out` and `System.err`. Output verbosity is based on the global logging level. The factory provides a preconstructed, customizable formatter automatically applied to all loggers it returns which prints more or less information in output based on logging level.

The Connection Pool is a simple JDBC Connection Pool library based on something from a personal project. Useful for small projects that use a database that may need to reuse database connections.
